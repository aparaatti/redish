# Redish #

## About ##

This is a simple awesome wm theme derived from the
[default](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/blob/v4.0/themes/default/theme.lua)
theme in awesome 4.0 and I intend to keep it working with the latest version.
The theme has two versions

The theme should be installed at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome/themes`, which
usually is `~/.config/awesome/themes` and it can be activated in awesome
configuration with:

```
...
beautiful.init(awful.util.getdir("config") .. 'themes/varish/theme.lua')
...
```

Out of the box the theme uses [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
and [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans) fonts, so
these should be installed or the font setting modified.

### Changelog ###

```

### Tag names on screenshots ###

People seemed interested on the tag names on screenshots, so if you want
something similar they come from the font
[FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) and are these
utf codes/characters:

```
➊ 
➋ 
➌ 
➍ 
➎ 
➏ 
➐ ☍
➑ 
➒ 
```

they should show up when using FiraCode as the font for tag names, adding them
is a simple matter of using copy paste to ones personal config files.
